On Windows Command Prompt, use this command:
`set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start`

On Windows PowerShell, use this command:
`$env:DEBUG='myapp:*'; npm start`

Every following time run `npm start`

Then load http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to access the app. You will not see much here since it will just a REST API
